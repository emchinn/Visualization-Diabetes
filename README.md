# Visualization-Diabetes

This is a visualization of diabetic patient hospital visits in the US. I used the R Shiny libraries to make an interactive web application to explore some of the data. 

The data is from 130 US hospitals between 1999 - 2008. It contains basic patient information (e.g. height, weight, gender, age) as well as information regarding the hospital visit, including: physician specialty, the number of days the patient was admitted, and the number of procedures performed on the patient.
